<p>
  My name is Brandilyn Hall and I'm from Amarillo, Texas. I am 30ish and was born in May. I am an only child
  and am very close to my family. I'm married to my husband of 11 years, Ben and we have 2 kiddos, Liam (2), and Emery (10 mo).
  We also have a chaweenie dog named Sadie (she's pretty neruotic). God has truly blessed me with an amazing family!
</p>

<p>
  I currently work as a Technical Communications Specialist at Happy State Bank in Amarillo, Texas.
  I have been there for 10 years and love it! I attended West Texas A&M University and graduated with my 
  degree in Political Science in 2009.
